#  Argo Research Infrastructure: Software Integration Level (SIL)

A framework to assess the development stage and/or integration level of Argo-related software, from early concepts to foundational tools.

## About

The Argo Research Infrastructure (RI) Software Integration Level (SIL) is a framework designed to evaluate and guide the development of Argo-related software. It provides a structured pathway for software to evolve from initial concepts to foundational components of the Argo RI.

Note that all software projects are NOT envisioned to be foundational components of the RI. A software project should simply choose the SIL that suits best the team's ambition. Once a SIL is chosen, follow the guidelines !

The SIL framework can serve as both a development roadmap and a certification system, ensuring that software meets the Argo RI's standards for quality, interoperability, and community integration.

Here is the list of SIL titles:
- 🏆 SIL-1: Basic Concept Exploration 
- 🛠️ SIL-2: Functional Prototype 
- 🧪 SIL-3: Minimal Viable Research Software 
- 🔄 SIL-4: Structured Open-Source Project 
- ✅ SIL-5: Verified Research Software 
- 👥 SIL-6: Community-Driven Tool 
- 🏗️ SIL-7: Robust Open-Source Software
- 🌍 SIL-8: Mature Open-Source Software
- 🏛️ SIL-9: Foundational Software

**SIL certification:**

SILs are envisioned as a two-way improvement feature:
- It helps RI staff develop software by providing clear benchmarks and goals.
- It provides software with a RI certification, recognizing its compliance with Argo RI expectations at a given level.

In other words, the SIL framework not only guides developers in progressively improving their software to meet higher standards, but also serves as a recognition system, certifying that a software meets the Argo Research Infrastructure's expectations for quality, interoperability, and community integration at a given level.

The certification is self-declarative.

**SIL vs development guidelines:**

Each SIL is assigned a list of [Argo software development guidelines](https://github.com/euroargodev/software_guidelines/issues) categorized as:
- 1-Recommended: This guideline is strongly encouraged.
- 2-Required: This guideline is mandatory.

‼️ Guidelines marked as "1-Recommended" at a given SIL are upgraded as "2-Required" for any upper SIL. Therefore, the higher the SIL, the higher the number of required guidelines to follow.

## SIL census

The number of guidelines attributed to a SIL is nearly gaussian, which creates a standard _learning curve_ with the steepest evolution starting at SIL-3 to reach SIL-4 and 5.
