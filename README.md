# Argo software development guidelines

This repository is dedicated to organise all the relevant content with regard to software development guidelines for the Argo community

In the realm of oceanographic research infrastructure, the Argo program stands as a cornerstone, providing invaluable examples of data management good practices. As part of the Euro-Argo ERIC, the development of collaborative and open-source software is crucial for leveraging Argo data effectively. However, researchers and data engineers, who may not have a background in software development, face unique challenges in creating software that are both robust and compliant with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). This is where tailored guidelines become essential.
